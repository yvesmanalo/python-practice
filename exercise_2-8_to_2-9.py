2-8. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations 
in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look 
like this:
print(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once 
on each line.
2-9. Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using 
that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that 
message.
